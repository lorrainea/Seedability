The data within this folder was generated using the generate_dataset program which is part of the WFA2-lib tool.
The datasets were generated using the following command:

```
./bin/generate_dataset -n 100 -l ell -e d -o output
```

where ell is the average length of the sequences ranging from 200 to 15000 and d the divergence of the sequence pairs ranging from 0.05 to 0.15.
